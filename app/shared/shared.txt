This module can include shared code that can be used by other modules in the application. Any shared directives, pipes, styles, reusable UI components (dumb components), unit tests can be added here. The difference between the core module and shared module is that shared module is injected in on-demand basis i.e. only the modules that need the shared module components need to inject it.
