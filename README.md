# Cyber Risk Dashboard
### Description:
  As systems and organizations become larger and more complex, those involved in making design decisions will face challenges regarding ways to identify, analyze, and prepare for threats and hazards, mitigate vulnerabilities, and minimize impact and consequences. This project aims to develop a cyber risk dashboard that supports asset management, threat source identification, and advanced threat assessment techniques to identify and score security vulnerabilities related to the people, processes, and systems of an organization. The dashboard is expected to provide a visual representation of the cyber risks to the organization and provides actionable information that can be used to make decisions and mitigate risks. 

  This project will involve the development of the requirements, architectural and detailed design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as user documentation of the cyber risk dashboard. The goal of the project is to develop a solution capable of providing more objective, reproducible, and consistent data that can be used by stakeholders to make decisions for how to improve the overall organizational security and resilience.
  
### Objectives:
  1. Develop an approach to identify the relevant assets, threat sources, and vulnerabilities for a complex organization.
  2. Establish a mechanism for scoring the identified vulnerabilities.
  3. Generate actionable data that can be support decision-making and be used as input for more detailed data-analysis methods.
  4. Implement a cyber risk dashboard to manage and visualize the data
  5. Provide recommendations and guidance based on the data to on how to improve the organizational security and resilience.
